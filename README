UI Dissertation in LaTeX

Updated by Ryan Allured

This update contains modifications made by Ryan Allured and several others. It was used to successfully submit a thesis in Dec. 2012. The thesis will compile with warnings; just press enter to ignore them, and it will successfully compile.

Importantly, this thesis uses the natbib package for the bibliography. References can be obtained from SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (http://adswww.harvard.edu/). The \bibitem can be obtained directly from ADS by selecting an abstract and clicking on the "Preferred format for this abstract" hyperlink below the abstract. Note that in some cases, you may need to adjust formatting for LaTeX (e.g., "quote" should be replaced by ``quote'').
